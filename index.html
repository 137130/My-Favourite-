   <p> My hobby is to spend time with family. I love to be around people and talk to everyone. I feel safe and secured around my family. It is a blessing to have a family. My family loves me a lot and we visit them every year. My fmily is huge and when ever we meet for family weddings or gatherings we have a lot of fun, since I have a lot of cousins. All of my family lives in India, but my mom's brother lives hear in Austin, Texas with his wife and two kids. My family recently visited them for three weeks. It was a big thing =, because they got their new house. Family is really important and I want to make sure I visit them a lot, infact I want to move to India. Although, because of corona aka covid-19 I could not see them for two years. I am waiting for 2022 summer so I can go to India and meet them. I love my family. </p>
